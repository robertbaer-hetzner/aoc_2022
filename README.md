Advent of Code 2022 in Javascript

https://adventofcode.com/

I will post my code as soon as I have finished the task for the day. :) 
This year I will try my best in Javascript.

How to execute the file:
     
     - Install Node.js: "sudo apt install nodejs npm"
     
     - Run script with: "node <Filename>"
  
  Have Fun!
